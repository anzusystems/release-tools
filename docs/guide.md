# Release guide

How a release gets from a branch to npm with `anzusystems/release-tools`.

In a project the commands are aliases in `package.json` (see [Running with npx](#running-with-npx)); run them with the project's package manager: `yarn release:start`, `pnpm release:start` or `npm run release:start`. The examples below use yarn and the package `@anzusystems/common-admin`.

You need Node 22.14+, git 2.38+, `gh` logged in with the scopes `repo` and `workflow`, and a git e-mail that GitHub knows (commits with an unknown e-mail may need an extra approval).

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `yarn release:start` | asks what to release, creates the release branch in its own folder next to the repository and an empty changelog file |
| `yarn release:publish` | publishes: a prerelease or a dev build (the branch stays) or the final version (merges into `main` after it is published, removes the branch and the folder unless they hold work that is not released) |
| `yarn release:cleanup` | deletes dev builds and tags that never became a release: all of them, or those older than a given number of days |
| `init` (run through npx, see [Running with npx](#running-with-npx)) | once per project: writes the release workflow, `release.config.json` and the aliases |

The commands run this tool through npx from GitHub; it is not published to npm. Nothing is installed in the project. You never create branches, tags or GitHub Releases by hand, and the tool never pushes to `main`.

**Every release starts with a pushed version tag** and is checked, built and published by GitHub Actions from exactly the tagged commit — never on your machine. A final version is tagged on the approved release pull request; the pull request is merged into `main` only after the version is published, so `main` always holds released code. Dev builds never reach npm.

A project that does not publish to npm (an application, `"publish": "none"`) gets the same branches, versions, tags, checks, changelog and GitHub Releases, just without npm.

## Rules

- `main` holds the latest released version. **Don't merge into `main`**, and don't merge a release pull request yourself; `release:publish` merges it after publishing. Changes outside the package (`.github/`, `doc/`) are the only exception.
- **Merge into the release branch** whatever belongs in the release. Commit messages do not matter.
- **Write the changelog yourself** in `doc/changelog/<version>.md`. Nothing is generated. The tool adds the line to the index `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Something failed?** Run the same command again; it continues where it stopped or tells you exactly what to do.

## New version: patch, minor, major

1. `yarn release:start` → pick patch, minor or major.
2. In the folder it opened, merge what belongs in the release and write the changelog.
3. If the project requires a tested prerelease (`requireTestedPrerelease`), publish an rc first and let it be tested.
4. `yarn release:publish` → final.

<details>
<summary>What happens in detail</summary>

`main` is at 3.0.0 and you want 3.1.0.

`yarn release:start` shows:
```
New release from main (3.0.0)
❯ patch   3.0.1
  minor   3.1.0
  major   4.0.0
  custom…
Hotfix of an older version
  2.30.1 → 2.30.2
  other…
Open releases
  release/3.0.1   cancel
```
After minor, it creates `release/3.1.0` from `origin/main` in `../common-admin-release-3.1.0`, adds `doc/changelog/3.1.0.md` from the template, pushes the branch, runs the install in the folder and prints its path. Your current checkout is not touched.

Merge into `release/3.1.0` — a pull request with that branch as the base, or a local merge in its folder. Push as you go.

`yarn release:publish` shows:
```
release/3.1.0
❯ final   3.1.0          publishes, then merges into main and removes the branch
  beta    3.1.0-beta.1
  rc      3.1.0-rc.1
  alpha   3.1.0-alpha.1
  dev     3.0.0-dev.20260923143000
```
Before final it checks that 3.1.0 is higher than the last released stable version and the version in `main`, that the repository allows merge commits into `main`, that no other release is published but not merged yet, that no open pull request besides the release pull request targets `release/3.1.0`, and that no changelog file of another unreleased version is left in the branch. Then it:
1. merges the current `main` into the branch (a conflict on the version or in the index is resolved automatically);
2. sets the version in `package.json`, the date in the changelog and the line in `CHANGELOG.md`;
3. opens the pull request `release: 3.1.0` into `main`;
4. waits until the pull request may be merged by the repository's rules. If an approval is required, it prints the link and waits; when only the approval is missing and you may bypass, it offers to go on without it and does so only after you confirm;
5. tags the approved head of the pull request `3.1.0` (with `requireTestedPrerelease` it records the tested rc in the tag). GitHub Actions runs the project's checks, builds, compares the package with the rc and publishes. If the checks or the build fail, nothing is published and nothing is merged: fix it in the branch and run the command again; if a later step fails, running the command again finishes it without publishing twice;
6. after the version is published, checks that npm recorded it from the tagged commit and merges exactly that commit into `main` (a merge commit, so the tagged commit stays in the history of `main`). If `main` moved on and GitHub refuses the merge, it first brings the pull request up to date with `main`; nothing but a plain merge of `main` is allowed on top of the published commit. If someone pushed to the branch after the tag, or the pull request was squashed or closed, it opens a new pull request from the tag (`release-merge/3.1.0`) instead, so that only the published code reaches `main`;
7. deletes the branch and the folder — unless they hold commits that are not in `main` or uncommitted changes. Then it keeps them, lists what is left, and `release:start` later offers to merge the commits into the next release.

Don't merge or close the release pull request yourself. If someone does, the command notices:
- **merged before the version was published** (also a squash right after the approval): it shows who merged it and whether it was approved, and only after you confirm it tags the code the merge put into `main` (moving an unreleased tag there) and publishes it. If the checks then fail, the fix goes through `release/3.1.0` brought up to date with `main`;
- **merged after the tag with a merge commit:** nothing more to do. Commits that reached `main` this way without being in the published version are listed as a warning; they go out with the next release;
- **closed before the version was published:** it stops and offers to reopen the pull request or to cancel the release;
- **squashed, rebased or closed after the version was published:** it opens a new pull request from the published commit.

In each case it also lists the pull requests that GitHub retargeted from the deleted release branch to `main`, because merging them would bring unreleased code into `main`.

</details>

## Prerelease and dev build

Neither reaches `main` or removes a branch: `release:publish` tags the current commit, and the pushed tag makes GitHub Actions check, build and publish it.

- **Prerelease (alpha, beta, rc)**, towards a version: `yarn release:start` → minor (or use the open release), then `yarn release:publish` → beta, as many times as you need. It is published to npm. Finish with final, or cancel the release in `release:start`.
- **Dev build**, just to try something out: on any branch, `yarn release:publish` → dev. It is not published to npm; the built package is attached to a GitHub Pre-release and admins install it from there. The branch stays yours; nothing is deleted.

The branch must contain the release workflow, i.e. come from `main` after the project switched to this tool; otherwise merge `main` into it first.

| | Prerelease `3.1.0-beta.2` | Dev build `3.0.0-dev.20260923143000` |
|---|---|---|
| npm | the version; the npm tag `beta` (`alpha`, `rc`) moves to it, never back to a lower version. `latest` never moves | nothing |
| git | the tag on the commit it was built from | the tag on the commit it was built from |
| GitHub | a Release marked Pre-release, never Latest, with the changelog file as it was at that moment (or the branch and commit, when there is no changelog file yet) | a Release marked Pre-release with the built package (`.tgz`) and the line to put in an admin's `package.json` |
| checks before publishing | the project's checks must pass | only the build has to pass |
| when it fails | nothing reaches npm; the next attempt gets the next number | nothing is published; the next attempt gets a new time or name |
| later | stays forever, also after the final 3.1.0 or a cancelled release | stays until `yarn release:cleanup` deletes it |
| admins using it | pin the exact version: `"@anzusystems/common-admin": "3.1.0-beta.2"` | use the URL from its GitHub Release; once the build is deleted, installing from that URL fails |

<details>
<summary>Ids and version numbers</summary>

| Id | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `alpha` | incomplete, the API may still change |
| `beta` | feature complete, being tested in the admins |
| `rc` | release candidate, fixes only |
| `dev` | a build to try something out, on GitHub only |

Prereleases:
- The number after the dot is counted from the prereleases that already exist, as tags or on npm: `3.1.0-beta.1`, `3.1.0-beta.2`, then `3.1.0-rc.1`. Each id has its own numbers per version.
- On a branch that is not a release branch, the version defaults to the next minor of the latest release (`3.1.0-alpha.1`); you can change it.
- There is no prerelease of a version that is already released: after 3.1.0, `3.1.0-beta.3` is refused.
- A prerelease of an older line (a hotfix) and a prerelease lower than the one the npm tag points to get the npm tag `<id>-X.Y`, e.g. `rc-2.30`, so `beta` and `rc` never move back.
- With `requireTestedPrerelease`, an rc from a `release/…` branch right before a final merges the current `main` into the branch first, so that it is the same as the final. A hotfix branch never merges `main`.
- Semver orders the ids alphabetically: `3.1.0-alpha.1` < `3.1.0-beta.1` < `3.1.0-rc.1` < `3.1.0`. It matters only for ranges; pin prereleases exactly.

Dev builds start with the nearest tag on GitHub the branch comes from (dev tags are skipped; your local tags do not matter), followed by the time in UTC, or by a name you type instead of the time:

| Where | Nearest tag | Dev build |
|---|---|---|
| a feature branch from `main` at 3.0.0 | `3.0.0` | `3.0.0-dev.20260923143000` |
| `release/3.1.0` after `beta.2` | `3.1.0-beta.2` | `3.1.0-beta.2.dev.20260923143000` |
| `hotfix/2.30.2` | `2.30.1` | `2.30.1-dev.20260923143000` |
| a feature branch, name `new-filter` | `3.0.0` | `3.0.0-dev.new-filter` |

A name starts with a letter, may contain letters, digits and hyphens, and must not be taken yet (no tag, no GitHub Release). The package file is always named `<package>-<version>.tgz`, e.g. `anzusystems-common-admin-3.0.0-dev.20260923143000.tgz`.

</details>

## Cleaning up

`yarn release:cleanup` lists the dev builds and the tags that never became a release (failed prereleases, the leftovers of an interrupted cancel), and asks:
```
14 dev builds, the oldest from 2026-06-02; 2 tags that never became a release
❯ delete all
  delete those older than … days
```
It shows what it will delete and asks for confirmation. It skips tags that have a run waiting or running and tags younger than two hours. For each item it deletes the finished runs of the tag first (so nobody can re-run them), then the tag and last the GitHub Release with its package, each only if it still exists, and checks at the end that nothing is left, so running it again finishes an interrupted cleanup. An item whose tag or GitHub Release changed after the list was shown is skipped whole. It never touches released versions or tags it did not create. The finished release runs of a version tag that is gone and not released are listed whoever created the tag: such a run can't show whose tag it was, and re-running it could release the tag pushed again. Admins that still point to a deleted dev build fail to install until they switch to another version.

## Hotfix of an older version

The latest is 3.0.0, but some admins still use 2.30.1.

1. `yarn release:start` → Hotfix → `2.30.1 → 2.30.2`.
2. In the folder it opened, put in the fix — cherry-pick it from `main`, merge a branch, or write it there — and write the changelog. Don't merge `main` into a hotfix branch.
3. If the project requires a tested prerelease, `yarn release:publish` → rc first.
4. `yarn release:publish` → final.

`latest` stays at 3.0.0. If the bug is in the latest version too, fix it there with a patch release as well.

<details>
<summary>What happens in detail</summary>

- `release:start` creates `hotfix/2.30.2` from the tag `2.30.1` in `../common-admin-hotfix-2.30.2`, adds `doc/changelog/2.30.2.md`, pushes and installs. Only the next patch of the last released version of a line can be released (2.30.2 after 2.30.1), and only for versions released with this tool. A patch of the latest line is a normal release from `main`.
- The hotfix is built the way its line was built: build command, install, Node, package manager and checks come from the configuration in the hotfix commit, not from today's `main`. GitHub Actions refuses a hotfix that contains code of a newer line.
- `release:publish` → final sets the version and pushes the tag `2.30.2`. The tag makes GitHub Actions check, build and publish 2.30.2 under the npm tag `latest-2.30`, without the Latest badge on GitHub. If the checks fail, nothing reaches npm; fix it in the branch and run the command again — it moves the tag to the fixed commit.
- Then the command opens the pull request `docs: changelog 2.30.2` with only the changelog file and its line in the index, waits until it is merged (and approved, if the repository requires it), and only then deletes the branch and the folder (it keeps them if they hold commits made after the tag or uncommitted changes; `release:start` later offers those commits for the next hotfix of the line). The code in `main` is not touched.
- Prereleases of a hotfix (`2.30.2-rc.1`) get the npm tag `rc-2.30`.
- Admins on 2.30 take the fix with `yarn up @anzusystems/common-admin@~2.30.2`.

</details>

## Other situations

<details>
<summary>An urgent patch while a bigger release is open</summary>

`release/3.1.0` is open and 3.0.0 needs a fix now.

1. `yarn release:start` → patch → `release/3.0.1` from `main`. Both releases are open at once.
2. Fix, changelog, `yarn release:publish` → final → 3.0.1 is published and merged into `main`.
3. `release/3.1.0` gets 3.0.1 automatically: its final `release:publish` merges the current `main` first. With `requireTestedPrerelease`, it then needs a new rc, because `main` changed.

Publish them in the order of their versions. If 3.1.0 is released first, the final of 3.0.1 stops before changing anything and asks for a new release with a higher version. If the final of 3.1.0 already has a tag that was not released (its checks failed), the final of 3.0.1 offers to withdraw that tag: `release/3.1.0`, its folder and its pull requests stay, and its next final creates the tag again. While one release is published but not merged into `main` yet, no other final starts.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Change the version of an open release</summary>

A breaking change came in and 3.1.0 has to become 4.0.0. There is no special command:

1. `yarn release:start` → major → `release/4.0.0`.
2. Merge `release/3.1.0` into `release/4.0.0`, move the content of `doc/changelog/3.1.0.md` into `4.0.0.md` and delete `3.1.0.md`.
3. `yarn release:start` → cancel `release/3.1.0`; it offers to retarget the open pull requests into it to `release/4.0.0`.
4. Continue with `release/4.0.0`: prereleases or final.

The final of 4.0.0 refuses to run while a changelog file of another unreleased version is still in the branch.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Drop a release</summary>

`yarn release:start` lists the open releases under **Open releases** → **cancel**. If the folder has uncommitted changes or the branch has commits not pushed yet, it stops until you deal with them. A release that is already published, or whose release pull request was already merged into `main` by hand, can't be cancelled; finish it with `yarn release:publish`. Otherwise it first offers to retarget the other open pull requests into the branch to another open release or to close them (GitHub would close them when the branch is deleted), closes the release pull request, deletes a final or hotfix tag that never became a release together with its finished runs, and then deletes the folder, the local branch and the branch on GitHub. Prereleases already published stay on npm; dev builds stay until `yarn release:cleanup`.

</details>

<details>
<summary>A release is published but not merged yet</summary>

The final was published, but the published commit is not in `main` yet — for example because a new push dismissed the approval. `main` then lags behind the released version. `yarn release:publish` offers to finish the merge; until then, no new release from `main` and no other final starts (a hotfix still does).

</details>

<details>
<summary>When something goes wrong</summary>

- The commands check everything before they change anything. When a check fails, nothing has happened: fix what the message says and run the command again.
- When a step fails half-way — network down, the laptop closed — run the same command again. It reads the state from GitHub, npm and the local folders and continues where it stopped; nothing is done twice. An interrupted tag move is finished by the next command, an interrupted cancel by running `release:start` → cancel again. Neither ever creates a tag for a version that is not released: only `release:publish` does, after all checks. The branch and the folder are removed only after the version is published and merged, or when you cancel the release.
- **Conflict with `main`** on the final publish: a conflict on the version or in the index is resolved automatically; for any other conflict the command leaves the merge unfinished in the release folder. Resolve the conflicts in the IDE, commit, and run `yarn release:publish` again.
- **The release run failed:**
  - a temporary error (npm or GitHub down): run `yarn release:publish` again; it re-runs the failed jobs of that run;
  - the checks failed: it shows the failing log. Fix it in the branch and run the command again. A final or a hotfix gets its tag moved to the fixed commit; a prerelease gets the next number; a dev build a new time or name;
  - publishing failed and nothing reached npm: it re-runs the publishing job, or creates the tag again on the same commit so that everything is built anew;
  - the version already reached npm but the GitHub Release is missing: it adds only the GitHub Release and never publishes the version twice;
  - no run started for the tag at all: a final or hotfix tag is created again on the same commit; a prerelease or dev build gets the next number or a new time.
- A version counts as used once it is released; from then on its tag never moves. Prerelease and dev tags never move at all. An old run of a tag that was moved or created again cannot publish anything but the commit of its own tag, because it checks the exact tag it started with. A deleted tag pushed again from someone's clone is refused, because a run never releases a tag that is an hour or more older than the run, `release:cleanup` deletes only tags older than two hours, and cancelling or cleaning up also deletes the finished runs of the deleted tag, so they can't be re-run.
- **More than 30 days later**, when GitHub no longer re-runs a run: a version that is not released gets its tag created again. A missing GitHub Release of a released version is always added by the command, at any time.
- **The npm tag points to the wrong version after publishing:** the run reports it as a warning. It cannot be changed with trusted publishing; someone with an npm token fixes it by hand.

All commands take `--dry-run`: they run the checks up to the first step that would change something, print that step and stop, without changing anything.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Checks</summary>

`release:start` stops when:
- `gh` is not logged in with the scopes `repo` and `workflow`, or `origin` is not the repository from `release.config.json`;
- for a new release from `main`: a release is published but not merged into `main` yet, or `main` holds a version that is not released because a release pull request was merged by hand (finish either with `release:publish`);
- the repository does not allow merge commits into `main`, or requires a merge queue;
- the version is not exactly `X.Y.Z` (no prerelease part, no `+build`) or not higher than the last released stable version it starts from;
- the version is already released, or has a tag or a branch on GitHub, or a foreign folder with its name exists (its own half-created release is continued instead);
- for a hotfix: it does not start from the last released version of its line, that line is the latest one, or that version was not released with this tool.

`release:publish` stops when:
- the release folder has uncommitted changes, an unfinished merge or conflict markers, or the branch on GitHub has commits that cannot be fast-forwarded into it; or it is run on `main` with local commits that are not on GitHub (it never pushes `main`);
- the changelog file is missing or has nothing but headings (for a prerelease it only warns);
- the version is already released (unless it is finishing that release);
- for a final release: another release is published but not merged yet, the version is not higher than the last released stable version and the version in `main` (equal to the version in `main` when the release pull request was merged by hand), an open pull request besides the release pull request targets the branch (it offers to retarget or close it), a changelog file of another unreleased version is in the branch, or — with `requireTestedPrerelease` — there is no released prerelease of the version (the candidate is the highest one, usually the last rc); also while the run of another final is still waiting or running, or while a stable tag of another version of the newest line is not released yet (it offers to finish that release, cancel it, or only withdraw its tag);
- for a hotfix with `requireTestedPrerelease`: there is no released prerelease of the hotfix;
- for a final or a prerelease from a hotfix branch: the branch contains code of a newer line (for example `main` was merged into it by mistake); cancel the hotfix and start again;
- the commit to be tagged does not have the release workflow; merge `main` into it first (not into a hotfix);
- the message of the commit to be tagged contains a marker that would skip the run (`[skip ci]`, `skip-checks: true` and similar).

With `requireTestedPrerelease`, GitHub Actions decides by comparing the packages.

Run outside a release folder, `release:publish` offers prereleases and a dev build of the current branch (which it pushes first; `main` is never pushed, so there it needs a commit that is already on GitHub) and the open releases; for a release it works in that release's folder, creating it when needed.

GitHub Actions checks again before publishing. These checks are not a security boundary: whoever can push to the repository can push a tag. The release run keeps the build of the branch's code apart from the job that is allowed to publish.

## Reference

<details>
<summary>Branches</summary>

| Branch | Created by | Starts from | Lives until |
|---|---|---|---|
| `main` | — | — | always; the latest release |
| `release/3.1.0` | `release:start` | `origin/main` | 3.1.0 is published and merged, or the release is cancelled; kept if it holds commits that are not in `main` |
| `release-merge/3.1.0` | `release:publish` | the published commit | its pull request is merged; only when the release pull request could not be merged as it was |
| `hotfix/2.30.2` | `release:start` | tag `2.30.1` | 2.30.2 is published and its changelog pull request is merged, or the hotfix is cancelled; kept if it holds commits made after the tag |
| your feature branches | you | anywhere | as you like |

</details>

<details>
<summary>Where changes go</summary>

| Change | Merge it into | When |
|---|---|---|
| Anything for the next version: features, fixes, refactors, dependency updates | the open `release/…` branch — a pull request with that branch as the base, or a local merge in its folder | any time before the final `release:publish`; open pull requests into the branch must be merged, retargeted or closed before the final |
| A fix for an older version | the `hotfix/…` branch (never `main` into it) | after `release:start` created it |
| Changes outside the package: `.github/`, `doc/` | `main`, through a normal pull request | any time; nothing gets released |

When no release is open, a finished feature waits: keep its pull request open, or start the release.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What GitHub Actions does</summary>

The project's release workflow (in common-admin `.github/workflows/release-package.yml`) starts on:
- **a pushed version tag** created by `release:publish` — the only way anything gets published. Tags without the tool's format and metadata are ignored. The run can check the format and the metadata, not who created the tag: someone who can push to the repository could imitate them, which is why these checks are not a security boundary. The run also ignores a tag an hour or more older than its run (for example an old deleted tag pushed again from someone's clone), a tag more than five minutes newer than its run (an old run re-run after the tag was created again), a final tag whose release pull request is closed or does not contain its commit, and a hotfix tag whose hotfix branch does not contain its commit (unless the changelog pull request of that hotfix is already in `main`).

It runs in two jobs:
- `build`, with no access to publishing and with the project's settings from the commit: it validates the tag (a final must contain the previous release; a hotfix must be the next patch and must not contain a newer line), installs, runs the project's setup and checks (`ci.setup`, `ci.checks`; not for a dev build), builds and packs. It checks that the version inside the package is right, the content of the package (`pack.verify`) and, for a stable version with `requireTestedPrerelease`, that it is the same as the rc recorded in the tag.
- `publish`, without the project's code and with a fixed environment set by the tool: it verifies that the package is the one `build` produced, checks its `package.json` again and that the tag is still exactly the one `build` saw, runs `npm publish`, checks that npm recorded the tagged commit, creates the GitHub Release, then checks the registry (integrity and npm tags) and reports a mismatch as a warning. When the version is already on npm with another content than the package of the run, the run ends with an error and no GitHub Release; `release:publish` does not add it either and stops with the link to the run. If the package on npm is right after all, create the GitHub Release by hand (`gh release create X.Y.Z --verify-tag`) and run `release:publish` again.

All release runs of the project wait in one queue, first in, first out (GitHub keeps up to 100 waiting). When the version is already on npm, a run only adds what is missing; the GitHub Release of a version released before the run started is added by `release:publish`.

Relative links in the changelog are turned into absolute links at the tag in the GitHub Release, where relative links would not work.

| Version | npm tag | GitHub Release |
|---|---|---|
| `3.1.0`, a final of the latest line | `latest` | Latest |
| `2.30.2`, a hotfix of an older line | `latest-2.30` | not Latest |
| `3.1.0-beta.2` | `beta` (`alpha`, `rc`) | Pre-release |
| `2.30.2-rc.1`, or a prerelease lower than the one its npm tag points to | `rc-2.30` (`<id>-X.Y`) | Pre-release |
| `3.0.0-dev.20260923143000` | not on npm | Pre-release with the `.tgz` |

</details>

<details>
<summary>Writing the changelog</summary>

`doc/changelog/<version>.md` starts from the project's template with the header `<version> — unreleased` and the sections Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed and Security. Write it for the people who maintain the admins: what changed for them and what they have to do. Name every breaking change together with the migration. Leave empty sections out.

The final publish replaces `unreleased` with the date of the final commit and rebuilds the index `CHANGELOG.md` from the released changelog files. The date does not change later, even when the approval takes days.

</details>

## Setting up a project

<details>
<summary>First setup with init</summary>

Run `npx -y --allow-git=all github:anzusystems/release-tools#main init` in the project. It detects what it can (package, repository, package manager, Node, whether the project publishes to npm), asks for the rest, and writes the release workflow, `release.config.json`, the aliases, the changelog template and the index. It never overwrites a file with different content without asking, and running it again only adds what is missing. The files reach `main` through a normal pull request. The repository must allow merge commits into `main` and must not require a merge queue.

</details>

<summary>First publish of a new npm package</summary>

npm lets you set up trusted publishing only for a package that already exists, so the very first version of a new package needs a one-time token. The tool does not handle that yet; it will get an optional input for it once a new npm package is planned. Until then, don't start a new npm package with the tool. Nothing is ever published from a computer, not even the first version.

<summary>Projects without npm and deployment</summary>

With `"publish": "none"` the release is the GitHub Release: prereleases are GitHub Pre-releases, a final of the newest line is the Latest release (a hotfix of an older line is not), dev builds are Pre-releases without a package. To deploy, add a job with `needs: publish` to the release workflow and use the outputs of the publish job:

| Output | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `version`, `tag` | the released version and its tag |
| `prerelease` | `true` for alpha, beta, rc and dev builds |
| `latest` | `true` when the version is the Latest release |
| `published` | `true` when the version is released, in this run or earlier |
| `released-now` | `true` when this run released it, in any attempt of the run |

Deploy only when `released-now == 'true' && latest == 'true'`, so that a hotfix of an older line is never deployed. A re-run of a run reuses the outputs of its first attempt, so the deploy job must also be safe to run twice and must check right before deploying that `tag` is still the Latest release (`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest`); otherwise re-running an old failed deployment could deploy an older version over a newer one. A deployment that reacts to GitHub Releases from outside (for example Azure) must deploy only published, non-prerelease releases that are Latest.

<summary>For maintainers of release-tools</summary>

The tool is a public repository and is not published to npm: the CLI always runs from GitHub (`github:anzusystems/release-tools#main`) and the action is `anzusystems/release-tools/publish@main`, so both come from the same `main`. It releases itself with its own commands as a project with `"publish": "none"` (a tag and a GitHub Release, nothing on npm). Its first release needs a seed commit directly in the empty `main`, then a bootstrap pull request with the first implementation, then the first release `1.0.0` from a local clone (`node bin/release.mjs`). A CLI command started before new versions were merged may create its tag days later, so the action accepts what any released CLI version creates; tag messages, release texts and the configuration are only extended, readers ignore what they don't know, and a change an older version cannot ignore goes out in two releases. The CLI loads all its files at start, because npx replaces the package in its cache when another run fetches a newer commit. The tool's `package.json` has no install or build scripts (npx would run `npm install` for a git package on every new commit), and its own `release.config.json` has `"build": false`. After 1.0.0, release the tool through its aliases (`github:…#main`), not from the release folder.

## Running with npx

The aliases in the project's `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "release:start": "npx -y --allow-git=all github:anzusystems/release-tools#main start",
  "release:publish": "npx -y --allow-git=all github:anzusystems/release-tools#main publish",
  "release:cleanup": "npx -y --allow-git=all github:anzusystems/release-tools#main cleanup"
}
```

The tool is not published to npm; the aliases run it from GitHub. npm 12 refuses git packages unless `--allow-git` allows it, and only `all` works with both npm 11 and 12.

Nothing is installed in the project; npx checks the current commit of `main` on every run. Use `npx` whatever package manager the project uses — the tool's README explains why `pnpm dlx` and `yarn dlx` are not recommended.
